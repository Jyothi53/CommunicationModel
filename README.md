Building a communication Model in MATLAB consisting of following blocks:
1. ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter): Converts analog signals into digital data for processing or
transmission.
2. Encoder: Converts digital data into specific symbols for efficient transmission.
3. Line coding: Maps digital data to physical signals suitable for transmission over a
communication channel. Essentially involves a pulse p(t).
4. Modulation: Embeds digital data into a carrier signal for efficient transmission through a
communication medium.
5. Channel: The medium through which signals (modulated data) travel from sender to receiver.
There is noise to the signal through this medium.
6. Demodulation: Extracts digital data from a modulated carrier signal at the receiver's end.
7. Line decoder: Converts received physical signals back into digital data after demodulation.
8. Decoder: Translates encoded digital data (symbols) back into bits.
9. DAC (Digital-to-Analog Converter): Converts digital signals back into analog form for output or
display.
